# Kui Nameplates
Prettier nameplates. Download releases [at Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/kuinameplates). Zips under the releases tab on GitHub are not complete packages!

I have a problem/question!
---
Issues submitted [here](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates/issues) won't necessarily receive a response, but I do read all of them. If you just want to ask a question or get in touch with me, the comments on Curse are a better option. I try to respond to all of those.

Remember these three points, however:
- I am human. I main a draenei, though.
- This addon was mainly created for myself.
- This addon is not meant to replace any other specific addon. It's just what I use.

That doesn't mean I won't consider feature requests. But it does mean I'm unlikely to spend much (or even a little) time developing a feature which I don't think I'll ever use. I'd prefer those to be provided by third-party modules or custom.lua scripts. The majority of small feature requests I receive are very simple to implement in [a custom.lua](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates-customs).
