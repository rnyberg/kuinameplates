* add option to show target arrows
* add option to avoid fading frames with raid icons (enabled by default)
* enabling the target glow option now also causes the usual frame glow to change to that colour on targets. This overrides the threat glow but doesn't stop tank mode from updating the health bar colour.
* Stanzilla: added new moonfire, sunfire spell ids
