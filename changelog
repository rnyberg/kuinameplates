* Customised frame sizes will need to be updated to remain consistent with
their pre-update size!
* improved graphical fidelity when fix aliasing is disabled, by removing some
outdated frame scaling functions. External modifications which use the
[addon]:RegisterSize function will need to be updated to remove that call as
it is no longer needed. :RegisterFontSize should still be used to scale fonts
with the user option.
